# kata-tennis-scoring-system

This Kata is about implementing a simple tennis scoring system.

It has been implemented in plain javascript (ES2015+), tests use Jest. You must have node and npm on your machine to run this.

## Usage

```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install
# To check that all tests run perfectly well and have a nice coverage report
npm run test
# To run a simple match runner that uses the result of this Kata
npm start
```
